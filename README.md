# Cloud-Native Test Automation with Docker & Jenkins  
This project is curated by me, **Hyder Shahzaib Ahmed**, to showcase my **test automation, CI/CD, and DevOps** skills. It simulates a **cloud-native environment** where I build and deploy a containerized microservice, then integrate **automated tests** to ensure reliability, security, and performance. By leveraging Docker, Jenkins, and Python (with optional Go or Robot Framework), this solution enables **seamless, automated testing** and **continuous delivery** without manual intervention.

---

## Problem  
Traditional software development processes often rely on **manual testing** and disjointed build pipelines. This leads to **slow releases**, **unreliable quality**, and **inconsistent security checks**. Teams need a **scalable, automated test framework** that can be easily integrated into day-to-day development and **cloud-native** workflows.

---

## Solution  
This project implements a **containerized microservice** and **automated test suite** with a **CI/CD pipeline** to provide:  
- **Continuous Integration** using Jenkins (or GitLab CI)  
- **Automated Functional & Integration Tests** (Pytest or Robot Framework)  
- **Docker-based Deployment** for consistent, reproducible environments  
- **Scalable Testing** that can include security and performance checks  
- **Day-to-Day Developer Automation** to reduce repetitive tasks

## Project Breakdown (Phases 1-3)
### Phase 1: Docker-Based Microservice Setup ✅  
We started by creating a minimal Flask microservice in Python and containerizing it with Docker:
- **Microservice Development**  
  - Developed a simple Flask API with two endpoints: the root (`/`) returning a welcome message and `/health` returning a status check.
- **Dockerfile Creation**  
  - Created a Dockerfile that installs the necessary dependencies, sets up the working directory, and runs the Flask app for reproducible builds across environments.
- **Local Environment**  
  - Built and ran the Docker image locally using `docker build` and `docker run`, confirming that the containerized service is accessible on port 5000.
- **Documentation & Verification**  
  - Provided clear instructions in the README on how to build and run the container, including example commands and how to test the endpoints using tools like `curl` or a web browser.

### Phase 2: Automated Testing Framework
This phase introduces **automated testing** to validate functionality, integration points, and reliability:  
- **Pytest or Robot Framework**  
  - Create test suites covering all REST endpoints (status codes, payloads, error handling).  
- **Test Configuration**  
  - Use environment variables or config files to point tests to local or remote instances.  
- **Test Execution**  
  - Run tests locally via `pytest` or `robot.` to ensure the containerized service meets requirements.  
- **Reporting**  
  - Generate pass/fail reports for quick feedback to developers.  

**Connectivity & Validation**:  
- Confirm tests run consistently in both local Docker environments and AWS-hosted environments.  
- Document any known issues or edge cases, laying a foundation for advanced scenarios (security/performance).

---

### Phase 3: Jenkins Integration & Basic CI/CD
This phase establishes a **CI/CD pipeline** to automate building, testing, and (optionally) deploying the microservice:  
- **Jenkins Setup**  
  - Configure a Jenkinsfile (or a freestyle job) with stages for build, test, and deploy.  
  - Integrate Docker in Jenkins to build images and run containers for testing.  
- **Pipeline Stages**  
  - **Build**: Pull the latest code, build the Docker image.  
  - **Test**: Spin up a container, run the automated test suite (Pytest/Robot).  
  - **Deploy (Optional)**: Push the image to a registry (Docker Hub, ECR) or deploy to AWS if tests pass.  
- **Basic CI/CD Checks**  
  - Validate changes with automated triggers on each commit (e.g., GitHub webhook).  
  - Provide test reports and notifications (Slack, email) for pass/fail outcomes.

---

## Future Plans  

### Phase 4: Security & Performance Testing  
- **Security Scanning**  
  - Integrate tools like **Trivy** (container vulnerability scanning) or **Bandit** (Python code security) into the pipeline.  
- **Performance/Load Testing**  
  - Use **Locust**, **k6**, or **JMeter** to simulate concurrent user loads and measure response times.  
  - Fail the pipeline if performance metrics degrade below a threshold.  
- **Documentation & Metrics**  
  - Provide clear guidelines on interpreting security/performance reports.

### Phase 5: Advanced DevOps & Container Orchestration  
- **Extended CI/CD**  
  - Implement advanced gating, parallel test suites, and environment promotion strategies.  
- **Kubernetes Deployment**  
  - Containerize the application and tests for ephemeral environments in EKS or a local K8s cluster.  
- **Infrastructure as Code**  
  - Use Terraform or CloudFormation to spin up Jenkins, container registries, or other AWS resources.  
- **Day-to-Day Developer Automation**  
  - Create scripts to automate environment setup, data seeding, or logs collection, reducing repetitive dev tasks.

### Phase 6: Multi-Service Integration  
- **Microservices Expansion**  
  - If needed, expand to multiple services with inter-service communication and more complex integration tests.  
- **Advanced Observability**  
  - Integrate logging and monitoring solutions (e.g., ELK stack, Prometheus/Grafana) to gain deeper insight into service health.
